# Hospital Emergency Analysis

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the emergency room (ER) data from a hospital to uncover key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights that can help improve patient care, reduce wait times, and enhance the overall efficiency of the ER.

## Dataset Used
The dataset used for this analysis is <a href="https://github.com/Sudharsan-T/Hospital-Emergency-Analysis/blob/main/Hospital%20ER_Data.csv">Hospital ER_DATA</a>, which contains detailed information on patient visits to the ER, including demographics, wait times, admission status, department referrals, and more.

## Questions (KPIs)
- **Number of Patients**: 
  - How many patients visited the ER in a given period?
  
- **Average Wait Time**:
  - What is the average wait time for patients in the ER?

- **Patient Satisfaction Score**:
  - How satisfied are the patients with their ER experience?

- **Patient Admission Status**:
  - What percentage of patients are admitted versus not admitted?

- **Patients by Age Group**:
  - How are patients distributed across different age groups?

- **Department Referrals**:
  - Which departments are patients referred to most frequently?

- **Patients Seen Within Target Time**:
  - What percentage of patients are seen within the target time of 30 minutes?

- **Gender Distribution**:
  - What is the gender distribution of the patients?

- **Patients by Race**:
  - What is the racial distribution of the patients?

- **Patients by Day and Hour**:
  - When is the ER most busy in terms of day and hour?

## Process
1. **Data Collection**: Gather the `Hospital ER_Data` dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Process the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
3. **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
4. **KPI Calculation**: Calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) as listed above.
5. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to present the findings.
6. **Interpretation**: Interpret the results to derive actionable insights.
7. **Reporting**: Compile the analysis into a comprehensive report or dashboard.

## Project Insights
- The average wait time provides a clear indicator of the efficiency of the ER.
- Peak hours and days of patient visits can help optimize staffing and resource allocation.
- Admission rates and patient satisfaction scores can guide improvements in patient care processes.
- Analyzing the demographic distribution can help tailor services to the specific needs of different patient groups.
  
## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the operations of the hospital ER. By identifying patterns in patient visits, wait times, and satisfaction levels, hospital administrators can implement strategies to enhance the efficiency and quality of care. Continuous monitoring and analysis are recommended to sustain improvements and adapt to changing patient needs.
